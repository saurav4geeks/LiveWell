          Stress is the feeling of being overwhelmed or unable to cope with
          mental or emotional pressure. Stress is our body’s response to
          pressure. Many different situations or life events can cause stress.
          It is often triggered when we experience something new, unexpected or
          that threatens our sense of self, or when we feel we have little
          control over a situation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When we encounter stress, our body produces stress hormones that
          trigger a fight or flight response and activate our immune system.
          This helps us respond quickly to dangerous situations. Sometimes, this
          stress response can be useful: it can help us push through fear or
          pain so we can run a marathon or deliver a speech, for example. Our
          stress hormones will usually go back to normal quickly once the
          stressful event is over, and there won’t be any lasting effects.

        <h2>Types</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Acute stress -</b>Acute stress happens to everyone. It’s the
            body’s immediate reaction to a new and challenging situation. It’s
            the kind of stress you might feel when you narrowly escape a car
            accident. Acute stress can also come out of something that you
            actually enjoy. It’s the somewhat-frightening, yet thrilling feeling
            you get on a roller coaster or when skiing down a steep mountain
            slope. These incidents of acute stress don’t normally do you any
            harm. They might even be good for you. Stressful situations give
            your body and brain practice in developing the best response to
            future stressful situations. Once the danger passes, your body
            systems should return to normal. Severe acute stress is a different
            story. This kind of stress, such as when you’ve faced a
            life-threatening situation, can lead to post-traumatic stress
            disorder (PTSD) or other mental health problems.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Episodic acute stress -</b>Episodic acute stress is when you have
            frequent episodes of acute stress. This might happen if you’re often
            anxious and worried about things you suspect may happen. You might
            feel that your life is chaotic and you seemingly go from one crisis
            to the next. Certain professions, such as law enforcement or
            firefighters, might also lead to frequent high-stress situations. As
            with severe acute stress, episodic acute stress can affect your
            physical health and mental well-being.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Chronic stress - </b>When you have high-stress levels for an
            extended period of time, you have chronic stress. Long-term stress
            like this can have a negative impact on your health. It may
            contribute to:<br />
            <ul>
              <li>Anxiety</li>
              <li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
              <li>Depression</li>
              <li>High blood pressure</li>
              <li>A weakened immune system</li>
            </ul>
            Chronic stress can also lead to frequent ailments such as headaches,
            an upset stomach, and sleep difficulties. Gaining insights into the
            different types of stress and how to recognize them helps.

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>
          Just as we each have different things that stress us out, our symptoms
          can also be different.

          <br />Although you’re unlikely to have them all, here are some things
          you may experience if you’re under stress:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Stress headache</b><br />Stress headaches, also known as tension
            headaches, are due to tense muscles in the head, face, and neck.
            Some of the symptoms of a stress headache are:
            <ul>
              <li>Mild to moderate dull head pain</li>
              <li>A band of pressure around your forehead</li>
              <li>Tenderness of the scalp and forehead</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Stress ulcer</b><br />It iss thought that physical stress may
            affect how you heal from an ulcer. Physical stress can be due to:
            <ul>
              <li>Trauma or injury to the brain or central nervous system</li>
              <li>Serious long-term illness or injury</li>
              <li>A surgical procedure</li>
            </ul>
            In turn, the heartburn and pain of a stomach ulcer can lead to
            emotional stress.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Stress eating</b><br />Some people react to stress by eating,
            even if they’re not hungry. If you find yourself eating without
            thinking, binging in the middle of the night, or generally eating
            way more than you used to, you might be stress eating. <br />When
            you stress eat, you take in a lot more calories than you need and
            you’re probably not choosing the healthiest foods. This can lead to
            rapid weight gain and a host of health problems. And it does nothing
            to resolve your stress. <br />If you’re eating to relieve stress,
            it’s time to find other coping mechanisms.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Work Stress</b><br />Work can be a source of great stress for any
            number of reasons. This kind of stress can be occasional or chronic.
            <br />
            Stress at work can come in the form of:
            <ul>
              <li>feeling you lack power or control over what happens</li>
              <li>
                feeling stuck in a job you dislike and seeing no alternatives
              </li>
              <li>being made to do things you don’t think you should do</li>
              <li>experiencing a conflict with a co-worker</li>
              <li>being overworked</li>
            </ul>
            If you’re in a job you hate or are always responding to others’
            demands without any control, stress seems unavoidable. Sometimes,
            quitting or fighting for more work-life balance is the right thing
            to do. This is how to know you’re headed for burnout at work.

        <h2>Causes of Stress</h2>
        <p>
          There’s no end to the things that can cause a person stress because
          they’re as varied as people are. Whatever the cause, the effect on the
          body can be serious if left unmanaged.

          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Discrimination</b> <br />
            Feeling discriminated against can cause long-term stress. For
            example, you may experience discrimination on the basis of your
            race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. Some people face
            discrimination and the stress it causes nearly every day.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Traumatic events</b><br />People who’ve experienced a traumatic

            stress. For example, you may experience long-term stress after
            surviving a robbery, rape, natural disaster, or war. In many cases,
            you may actually have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

        <h2>Stress management</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of stress management isn’t to get rid of it completely. It’s
          not only impossible, but, stress can be healthy in some situations.
          Over time, managing your stress levels may help lower your risk for
          stress-related diseases. And it’ll help you feel better on a daily
          basis, too.

          <br />
          Here are some basic ways to start managing stress:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>maintain a healthy diet</li>
          <li>aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night</li>
          <li>exercise regularly</li>
          <li>minimize your use of caffeine and alcohol</li>
          <li>stay socially connected so you can get and give support</li>
          <li>make time for rest and relaxation, or self-care</li>
          <li>learn meditation techniques such as deep breathing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While stress is a normal part of life, too much stress is clearly
          harmful to your physical and mental well-being.If you can’t manage
          your stress, or if it’s accompanied by anxiety or depression, see your
          doctor right away. These conditions can be managed with treatment, as
          long as you seek help. You might also consider consulting with a
          therapist or other mental health professional.
